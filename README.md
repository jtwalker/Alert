This is a solo Android project by Justin Walker.

This project is part of an independent study to explore the finer nuances of Android development.


The propose of this project is to create an alarm that is useful for individual who are either unable to function with a traditional alarm or for those looking for a more visual experience when viewing their alarm. With that stated, the intended audience are those individuals who need help with their everyday life and the simplicity of the user interface and the myriad of support member options help to reinforce this point.

What the alarm does: Instead of just showing your clock when an alarm sounds, this alarm also displays a selected image. These pictures can be used to remind the individual what is to be done upon hearing the alarm or simply provide a more pleasing alarm experience. 

In essence, this alarm could be setup to lay out an entire day solely through the use of images.
